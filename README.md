# Project Name

## Project Description
Provide a brief description of what your project does and its purpose. Explain the significance of the two datasets and how the different machine learning algorithms apply to them.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two main folders: `set1` and `set2`. Each folder contains Python scripts for various machine learning algorithms tailored to a specific dataset:

- `set1`: Contains machine learning algorithms for `dataset1`
  - `adaboost.py`
  - `decision.py`
  - `svm.py`
  - `naive.py`
  - `knn.py`
- `set2`: Contains machine learning algorithms for `dataset2`
  - `adaboost.py`
  - `decision.py`
  - `svm.py`
  - `naive.py`
  - `knn.py`

## Running the Code
To run a specific machine learning algorithm on its corresponding dataset, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Choose the dataset you want to work with (`set1` for `dataset1` and `set2` for `dataset2`).
4. Change the directory to the chosen set's folder. For example, to work with `set1`, you would use:
   ```
   cd set1
   ```
5. Run the desired algorithm's script using Python 3. For example, to run the AdaBoost algorithm on `set1`, execute:
   ```
   python3 adaboost.py
   ```

Replace `adaboost.py` with the name of the script you wish to run (e.g., `decision.py`, `svm.py`, `naive.py`, `knn.py`).

## Support
For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository or contact the project maintainer directly.
