# Machine Learning Clustering Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts implementing various clustering algorithms and an ANOVA test to compare their performances. The scripts are organized to work with different datasets as part of a machine learning course or research.

## Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Project Structure
The project is organized into two datasets: `cho.txt` and `iyer.txt`. This folder contains Python scripts for various machine learning algorithms tailored to both datasets:

  - `dbscan.py` - Implements the DBSCAN clustering algorithm
  - `mm.py` - Implements the Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  - `hac.py` - Implements Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC)
  - `Spectral.py` - Implements Spectral Clustering
  - `Kmeans.py` - Implements k-means Clustering
  - `anova.py` - Performs an ANOVA test to compare the performance of clustering algorithms

## Running the Code
To run a specific clustering algorithm or perform the ANOVA test, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Choose the algorithm you want to work with (`HAC` using 'hac.py').
4. Change the algorithm to the chosen Algo's folder. For example:
5. Run the desired algorithm's script using Python 3. For example, to run the k-means algorithm, execute:

Replace `Kmeans.py` with the name of the script you wish to run, such as `dbscan.py`, `mm.py`, `hac.py`, `Spectral.py`, or `anova.py` to perform the ANOVA test.

## Support
For any questions or issues, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository or contact the project maintainer directly.
